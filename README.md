**Halo** is a command-line shell reimagined from the ground up. Frustrated with the limitations of traditional terminals, Halo leverages the power of **Rust**, **Tokio**, and **Ratatui** to provide an incredibly fast, non-blocking, and visually rich experience. Its bottom-up, block-based interface makes tracking command history more intuitive than ever.

## ‚ú® Features

*   üöÄ **Blazingly Fast & Asynchronous**: Built in Rust on top of Tokio, ensuring a non-blocking UI that remains responsive even while commands are running.
*   üé® **Modern Bottom-Up TUI**: A chat-like interface where commands flow upwards. No more endless scrolling to find where a command's output begins.
*   üß† **Context-Aware Autocompletion**: `Tab` completion for system executables, built-ins, and file paths. It's smart enough to suggest *only* directories after `cd`.
*   üìú **Intuitive History Preview**: Seamlessly scroll up through your history. Each command and its complete output is treated as a single, easily reviewable block.
*   üîß **Git Integration**: The status bar instantly shows your current Git branch and status (‚úî for clean, ÔÑ™ for dirty).
*   üíÖ **Stylish & Cohesive Design**: A beautiful "Cyber-Nord" theme that is both modern and easy on the eyes. Every component has been styled for a uniform and professional look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Halo is built with standard Rust tooling.

#### Prerequisites
*   [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
*   A Nerd Font (for icons like `ÓÇ†`, `üìÅ`, `‚ö°`) is highly recommended for the best visual experience. [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) is a great choice.

#### Building from Source
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Goddv/halo.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd halo
    ```
3.  Build and run for development:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```
4.  For the best performance, build a release binary:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```
    The executable will be located at `target/release/halo-shell`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage & Keybindings

| Key(s)           | Action                                                                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Typing Text**  | Enters commands. If you are in history preview mode, this will instantly exit it and start a new command. |
| **Tab**            | Activates context-aware autocompletion. Cycles through suggestions if the menu is open.            |
| **Enter**          | Executes the current command.                                                                      |
| **Ctrl+C**         | Kills the currently running command or exits completion menu.                                        |
| **Mouse Wheel**    | Scrolls up and down through the command history, activating preview mode.                           |
| **PageUp/PageDown**| Scrolls through history in larger steps.                                                           |
| **Up/Down Arrow**  | Navigates through command history (only when not in preview mode).                                   |
| **Esc**            | Exits the completion menu.                                                                         |
